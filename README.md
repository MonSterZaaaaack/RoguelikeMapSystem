This project is inspired by the **Slay-the-Spire Map in Unity** project by **Silverua**.

## Overview
This system enables the **auto-generation of multi-layered, multi-branched roguelike maps** based on user-defined settings. It provides a flexible and customizable approach to map creation, allowing for both procedural generation and manual configuration.

## Features
- **Scrollable Maps** â€“ Supports oversized maps with smooth scrolling.  
- **Weighted Randomized Node Generation** â€“ Dynamically creates nodes based on predefined node type weights.  
- **Weighted Path Generation** â€“ Paths are generated according to node type weights.  
- **Rich Customization Options**, including:
  1. **Layer Configuration** â€“ Define layer width, min/max node count, procedural or custom layers, etc.
  2. **Custom Map Nodes** â€“ Set node size, type, state, and callbacks.
  3. **Custom Path Nodes** â€“ Adjust size, direction, attached images, and more.
- **Prevention of X-Shaped Paths** â€“ Ensures a clean, non-overlapping structure.  
- **Save & Load Support** â€“ Stores map data locally for future use.
